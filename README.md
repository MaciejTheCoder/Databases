# Databases
Project from Databases classes.

I chose a topic Geographic databases: regions, animals, plants. I decided to prepare a database for National Nature Park Management(or Ministry of the environment). This database is created for managing and preparing observation programs for
chosen animal and plant population.
Users? I think it’s done for national parks and ministry employees – it must be easy to use. Of course there will be a few IT workers to manage this database, but it has nice interface, prepared for employees and scientist, to observe and analyze populations. 
Possible use scenario is preparing annual observations of all animals/plants populations, which live in some national parks.
